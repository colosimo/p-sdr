Portable Software Defined Radio

P-SDR is a project aiming to provide free source code for the community
of radio amateurs. "Portable" means that the same code will be able to
run both on powerful PCs and on smaller embedded devices, even those
based on MCUs.

Official repository is https://github.com/colosimo/p-sdr

Basic characteristics
- support for some common SDR hw (starting from dongles based on RTL2832U);
- support for some common architectures (meaning platform hw + operating
system);
- everywhere usage of fixed point numbers; overflow-safe arithmetic functions
and CORDIC algorithm implemented;
- strong separation between arch-dependent code (all in arch/ directory) and
arch-independent code (in src/ and include/);
- a set of (non portable) tools to be run on PC, mostly for constants
pre-computation, test or data offline analysis;
- clean and easily understandable code;
- a fair amount of comments.
