I started writing P-SDR for my personal enjoyment, though I hope it will
sooner or later be helpful for other enthusiastic programmers, radio engineers
and radio amateurs.

I strongly believe in open source code, which gave so much to my professional
growth, so I'm releasing all of my work to whom is interested in using it.

Thus, where no otherwise declared, source code and documentation of P-SDR
Library and related tools are released under the so-called 'MIT-Expat' License:
